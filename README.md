This app utilizes the National Park Service API to allow users to explore the different National Parks and Monuments in their state. 

### Technical Notes
- I chose to build this application in VueJS, which is the framework with which I have the most experience. I utilized the Vue 3 composition API, which I haven't had the chance to use before this! 

- The initial build was created using <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue">create-vue</a> a handy command line tool for quickly creating pre-configured, ready-made single page apps using Vue and Vite. 

- Instructions to run the project locally are included below. 

That's it! I'm happy to answer any further questions about the code and tools I used.
